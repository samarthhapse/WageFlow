### 🚀 Employee Payroll System in Java

Welcome to the Employee Payroll System project! This repository showcases a well-structured, terminal-based payroll management system built using Java and follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement an Employee Payroll System with a strong focus on OOP concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. It enables organizations to manage employee payroll efficiently, supporting full-time and part-time employees with automated salary calculations.

# 🔍 Project Highlights

1. Abstract Employee Class: Serves as the base class for different employee types. FullTimeEmployee & PartTimeEmployee Subclasses: Extend the base class to implement salary calculations.

2. JDBC & MySQL Integration: Stores employee data in a database and retrieves it efficiently.

3. User-Friendly Terminal Interface: Provides an easy-to-use CLI for managing payroll details.

4. Encapsulation & Data Security: Private attributes with proper getter and setter methods.

5. Polymorphism in Action: Overridden methods for salary calculation based on employee type.
